# hello-world
my first repository(crossing fingers)
Well I have been trying to learn how to code on Khan Academy for a little less than a month now. What I didn't know is I am learning processing Javascript instead of actually java script. So this is awkward but I have heard it is basically safety wheels for the real javascript. Mostly same concepts just a little more intricate and complex.
